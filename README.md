# Parallel Computing Project

## Overview
This project explores the parallelization of K-means clustering and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms using OpenMP and MPI. The implementation and analysis were conducted on a laptop with an Intel Core i5-1035G4 processor, 15.6 GB RAM, running Windows, utilizing Visual Studio Code and MPI SDKs for C/C++.
